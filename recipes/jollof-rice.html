        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>

        <li>1 cup sliced carrots (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked chicken or beef (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger. Cook until the tomatoes break down and the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li>Add paprika, dried thyme, curry powder, white pepper, and bay leaves. Stir to combine and cook for about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and water. Season with salt and black pepper. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rinsed rice. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>If using peas, carrots, or cooked chicken/beef, gently stir them into the rice during the last 10 minutes of cooking.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it sit covered for about 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.</li>
