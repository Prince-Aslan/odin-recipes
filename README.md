# odin-recipes


This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and is designed to help me practice the basics of HTML. The aim is to build a basic recipe website with a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. 

## Project Structure
- The website will consist of:
  - A main index page that links to a few recipes.
  - Each recipe page will include:
    - Recipe title
    - Ingredients list
    - Cooking instructions

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will demonstrate:
- Understanding of HTML structure
- Ability to create and link web pages
- Use of headings, lists, images, and links in HTML
- Basic understanding of organizing a project directory for a website

This project focuses on building my HTML skills, and in future lessons, I will enhance this site by adding CSS for styling.
